## Git Workflow:
[Feature-Branch-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

The nameconvention for branches is:

- bugfix/.. for bugs
- feature/.. for features
- hotfix/.. for hotfixes
- release/.. for releases

Merging into develop is only permitted by pull request with the approval by the repos owner.

## Organization:
Right now there's only one developer on this project. The organization is therefore loose.
